How to commit changes (as far as I know).

1. got to github.com 
2. download and install github (github for windows is the one I'm currently using)
3. open up the github program (it take a little bit for it to start on my computer)
4. in the top-left corner click the plus sign, and go to clone?
	It looks like there's also an option in the web interface for that says "clone to desktop"

5. Make changes to a file or create files

6. go to github and select the repository
7. add a short summary of the changes and click commit
8. then click Sync in the top-right corner
