How to commit changes (as far as I know).

1. got to github.com (and create an account if you don't have one)
2. login and go to https://github.com/sjTaylor/dnSim
3. in the top right corner click on fork to fork the repository to your account
4. download and install github (github for windows is the one I'm currently using)
5. open up the github program
6. in the top left click + > clone > dnSim > Clone dnSim
7. Then choose a place to put the fork of the project on your desktop

8.  Make changes
9.  press sync in the top right corner of the github program
10. press show next to 'Uncommited changes' and fill out a description
11. press commit to master
12. press sync again
13. press create pull request (to the left of sync)
14. where it says from master into master click master
	then (what I expect is) sjTaylor/master 
15. Send pull request

^^the above is how I think it is done for people not added as contributors to the repository

probably a lot simpler for registered contributers.
