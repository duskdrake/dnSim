#dnSim

The goal of this project is to creat a data-driven skill simulator for Eyedentity's game "Dragon Nest"

Use and files in this repository at your own risk.

Software is provided as is.

##How to use:

Select server, then select class.

Left click to rank up

Right click to rank down

shift-click to maximize, and minimize ranks

specialization selector on the right will allow you to see all classes, or classes individually.
This is so that smaller monitors (hopefully) don't have an issue. 

Ctrl-r to reset skill selection (sets all to minimum possible ranks)
